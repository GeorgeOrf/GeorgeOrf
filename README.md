Hello, I'm George Orfanidis. I’m currently a 4th-semester student in the Computer Applications Technician program at S.A.E.K. Monastiriou. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, although I have a strong passion for web design.

I’m proud to have earned 2nd place in the national EuroSkills/WorldSkills competition held in Athens on March 18, 2025.

Right now, I’m training with an amazing team focused on web development as we prepare for the EuroSkills 2025 competition in Herning, Denmark. Our mentors are guiding us through the latest technologies and real-world practices.

I may be at a beginner level, but I’m highly motivated and committed to learning and improving every single day.
