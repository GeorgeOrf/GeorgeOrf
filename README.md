I recently graduated from the Computer Applications Technician program at S.A.E.K. Monastiriou. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, although I have a strong passion for web design.

I’m proud to have earned 2nd place in the national EuroSkills/WorldSkills competition held in Athens on March 18, 2025.

Right now, I’m training with an amazing team focused on web development as we prepare for the EuroSkills 2025 competition in Herning, Denmark. Our mentors are guiding us through the latest technologies and real-world practices.
I'm also working on personal full-stack projects to further develop my skills, including building an e-shop for a group of friends who are planning to launch their own t-shirt brand soon.

I may be at a beginner level, but I’m highly motivated and committed to learning and improving every single day.
